CSS Syntax
    - CSS Syntax is very different than HTML
    - CSS is a set of 'rules' which in include a 'separator' and one or more
    'properties' or 'values' as well as some punctuation...
        ex.
            body {
                font-family: arial, sans-serif;
            }

Referencing CSS in HTML
    - CSS can be referenced as a style tag in paragraph tags
        ex.
            <p style="border-color: red;">
            Some text.
            </p>
    - You can put CSS rules in header as a style tag in addition to the title
    tag
        ex.
            <head>
                <title>MY APP</title>
                <style>
                    body {
                        font-family: arial, sans-serif;
                    }
                </style>
            </head>
    - You can put the CSS rules in another file. Reference the following syntax
    to do so
        ex.
            <head>
                <title>CSS from DOC</title>
                <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="rules.css">
            </head>

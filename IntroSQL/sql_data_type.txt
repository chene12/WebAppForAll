STRING FIELDS
    - These data type include CHAR and VARCHAR
    - Most common character fields
    - Aware of other character sets (Latin, Asian)
    - CHAR allocates the entire space
    - VARCHAR allocates a certain amount of space depending on the data length
    - If most of the data are going to be about a certain character length, use
    CHAR, else use VARCHAR
    - For example, if you are storing 9 digit IDS, it better to use CHAR, since
    all the data will be 9 character length
    - If storing something like name, use VARCHAR because names vary in length


TEXT FIELDS
    - Uses a type of character set
        - TINYTEXT up to 255 characters
        - TEXT up to 65k
        - MEDIUMTEXT up to 16m
        - LONGTEXT up to 4g
    - Not suitable for indexing or sorting (ORDER BY won't work well on them)


BINARY TYPES (RARELY USED)
    - Character = 8-32 bits of info depending on character set
    - Byte = 8 but of info
        - BYTE(n) up to 255 byte
        - VARBINARY(n) up to 65k bytes
    - Small images - data
    - Not indexed or sorted


BINARY LARGE OBJECT (BLOB)
    - Large raw data, files, images, word documents, PDFS, movies, etc.
    - No translation, indexing, or character set
        - TINYBLOB(n) up to 255
        - BLOB(n) up to 65k
        - MEDIUMBLOB(n) up to 16m
        - LONGBLOB(n) up to 4g


INTEGER NUMBERS
    - Integers are very efficient, take little storage, and are easy to process
    - TINYINT (-128, 128)
    - SMALLINT (-32768, 32768)
    - INT or INTEGER (2 billion)
    - BIGINT (10**18 ish)


FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
    - Limited accuracy but high range of representation
        - FLOAT (32-bit) 10**32 with seven digits of accuracy
        - DOUBLE (64-bit) 10**308 with 14 points of accuracy


DATES
    - TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' number of seconds since 1970
        - Stored in 32-bt format, is really an integer
        - Can't calculate milliseconds
    - DATETIME 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
        - More general and stores more dates (even before 1970)
        - Takes little for space
    - DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    - TIME 'HH:MM:SS'
    - Built in MySQL function NOW()
        - Returns current time and date
